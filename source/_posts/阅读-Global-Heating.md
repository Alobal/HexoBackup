# Earth has lost 28 trillion tonnes of ice in less than 30 years

在不到 30 年里，地球已经失去了 28 万亿吨冰

A total of 28 **trillion** tonnes of ice have disappeared from the surface of the Earth since 1994. That is stunning conclusion of UK scientists who have analysed satellite surveys of the planet’s poles, mountains and **glaciers** to measure how much ice coverage lost because of global heating triggered by rising greenhouse gas **emissions**.

自从 1994 年以来，地球表面总计消失了 28 万亿吨的冰。英国科学家们，分析了卫星关于地球两极，山脉，冰川的探测数据，以测量温室气体排放量上升导致的全球变暖引起了多少冰覆盖面积的损失，最终得出了这个惊人的结论。

The scientists – based at Leeds and Edinburgh universities and University College London – describe the level of ice loss as “**staggering**” and warn that their analysis indicates that sea level rises, triggered by melting glaciers and ice sheets, could reach a metre by the end of the century.

来自 Leeds and Edinburgh universities 和 University College London 的科学家们，将这种程度的冰损失称为“惊人的”。并且警告，他们的分析结果表明，冰川和冰盖的融化会引起在世纪末可达一米高度的海平面上升。

“To put that in **context**, every centimetre of sea level rise means about a million people will be displaced from their low-lying homelands,” said Professor Andy Shepherd, director of Leeds University’s Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling.

“具体放在情境中来讲，每一厘米的海平面上升都会导致百万低洼地带的人民流离失所。”。Leeds 大学的两极观察和建模中心主任，Andy Shepherd 教授说到，

The scientists also warn that the melting of ice in these quantities is now seriously reducing the planet’s ability to reflect solar radiation back into space. White ice is disappearing and the dark sea or soil exposed beneath it is **absorbing** more and more heat, further increasing the warming of the planet.

科学家们还警告称，这种数量级的冰融化正在严重地降低地球反射太阳辐射回太空的能力。白色的冰正在消失，而在其之下的黑色的海面或者是土壤正在吸收越来越多的热量，进而加剧了全球变暖。

In addition, cold **fresh water** pouring from melting glaciers and ice sheets is causing major disruptions to the biological health of Arctic and Antarctic waters, while loss of glaciers in mountain ranges threatens to **wipe out** sources of fresh water on which local communities depend.

另外，冰川冰盖消融的冷淡水的倾泻，正在对南北极水域的生态健康造成严重破坏，另一方面山脉冰川的流失，也危及着当地生态圈赖以生存的淡水源。

“In the past researchers have studied individual areas – such as the Antarctic or Greenland – where ice is melting. But this is the first time anyone has looked at all the ice that is disappearing from the entire planet,” said Shepherd. “What we have found has stunned us.”

“在之前，研究者们调查了个别冰正在消融的地区——例如南极和格陵兰岛。但是，这是第一次有人统计了从这个星球上消失的所有冰，” Shepherd 说道，“而随之而来的结论震惊到了我们。”

The level of ice loss revealed by the group matches the worst-case-**scenario** predictions outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), he added.

他称，“这个团队揭示出的冰块消融程度，也大致上符合政府间气候变化委员会作出的最坏情景预测。”

The group studied satellite surveys of glaciers in South America, Asia, Canada and other regions; sea ice in the Arctic and Antarctic; ice sheets that cover the ground in Antarctica and Greenland; and **ice shelves** that **protrude** from the Antarctic mainland into the sea. The study covered the years 1994 to 2017.

这个团队调查了，来自南美、亚洲、加拿大和其他国家的卫星冰川探测数据；南北极的海冰数据；南极和格陵兰岛的冰盖数据；以及从南极主板块向海面突出的冰架。这个调查涵盖了1994至2017年。

The researchers’ conclusion is that all the regions have suffered **devastating** reductions in ice cover in the past three decades and these losses are continuing.

这些研究者的结论表明，在过去的三十年中，所有国家都存在毁灭性的冰盖减少，并且如今仍在继续发生。

“To put the losses we’ve already experienced into context, 28 trillion tonnes of ice would cover the entire surface of the UK with a sheet of frozen water that is 100 metres thick,” added group member Tom Slater from Leeds University. “It’s just mind-blowing.”

“这些我们已经经受的损失具体来看，28万亿吨的冰，能够以100米的厚度的大冰盖的形式覆盖整个英国表面，” Leeds 大学的团队成员Tom Slater 补充道，“这是十分让人难以置信的。”

As to the cause of these staggering losses, the group is **adamant**: “There can be little doubt that the vast majority of Earth’s ice loss is a direct consequence of climate warming,” they state in their review paper, which is published in the online journal Cryosphere Discussions.

至于这惊人损失的始作俑者，团队坚定不移地认为：“毫无疑问，地球巨量的冰损失是全球变暖的一个直接结果，” 在网络杂志Cryosphere Discussions出版的一篇采访文章中，他们这样说明。

“On average, the planetary surface temperature has risen by 0.85C since 1880, and this signal has been amplified in the polar regions,” they state. Both sea and atmospheric temperatures have risen as a result and the resulting double **whammy** has triggered the **catastrophic** ice losses uncovered by the group.

“平均来讲，地球的表面温度自从1880年以来上升了0.85℃，而这一特征在在极地地区则进一步被放大，” 他们说道。就结果而言，海洋和大气层温度都上升了，并且随之产生的双重打击引发了被这个团队发现的灾难性冰损失。

In the case of the melting ice sheet in Antarctica, rising sea temperatures have been the main driver while increasing atmospheric temperatures have been the cause of ice loss from inland glaciers such as those in the Himalayas. In Greenland, ice loss has been triggered by a combination of both sea and atmospheric temperatures increasing.

对于南极的冰盖消融来讲，上升的海水温度是主要导致因素，另一方面，上升的大气层温度则是例如在Himalayas之类的内陆冰川消融的主要元凶。在格陵兰岛，则是由海水和大气层两者的升温联合导致了冰消融。

The team stressed that not all the ice that was lost over that period would have contributed to sea level rises. “A total of 54% of the lost ice was from sea ice and from ice shelves,” said Leeds University researcher Isobel Lawrence. “These float on water and their melting would not have contributed to sea level rises. The other 46% of meltwater came from glaciers and ice sheets on the ground, and they would have added to sea level rise.”

团队强调，在这段时期内的冰消融并没有都助力了海平面上升。“总计54%的冰消融是来自于海洋冰和冰架，” Leeds 大学的研究员 Isobel Lawrence 说道，“它们是附在水面上的，并且它们的消融不会导致海平面升高。另外的46%融水来自地面上的冰川和冰盖，这些才会导致海平面上升。”

The group’s results were published 30 years after the first **assessment** report of the IPCC was published, at the end of August 1990. This outlined, in **stark** **terms**, that global warming was real and was being triggered by increasing emissions of greenhouse gases from the burning of **fossil** fuels.

距IPCC的第一份评估报告于1990八月末发布的三十年之后，这个团队的成果发表了他们的成果。简而言之，全球变暖被证实了，并且由于持续增长的化石燃料燃烧，进而导致的温室气体排放的影响，全球变暖仍在继续发生。

Despite warnings from scientists, these emissions have continued to rise as global temperatures continued to **soar**. According to figures released by the Met Office last week, there was a 0.14C increase in global temperatures between the decade 1980-89 and the decade 1990-1999, then a 0.2C increase between each of the following decades. This rate of increase is expected to rise, possibly to around 0.3C a decade, as carbon emissions continue on their upward **trajectory**.

不顾科学家们的警告，尽管全球温度持续升高，温室气体排放量仍在增长。据英国气象局上周公布的数据，在1980\~1989和1990\~1999间都有0.14℃的增长，而在接下来的每十年中，都有0.2℃的增长。随着碳排放量持续上升，变暖速率也预计会增加，可能会达到每十年0.3℃左右。
