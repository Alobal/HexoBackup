# US to drop death penalty for British Isis members accused of beheadings

美国对被指控斩首的，英国 Isis 成员，处以死刑。

The US has promised not to pursue the death penalty against two British Isis members accused of taking part in the beheadings of western hostages, in return for UK cooperation with the prosecution.

美国保证不对——两名参与西方人质斩首的英国 Isis 成员——追究死刑，以换取英国能与起诉方合作。

The pledge was given in a letter from the US attorney general, William Barr, to UK home secretary Priti Patel, in the case of Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh, members of the “Beatles” group of British Isis members, who were captured by Syrian Kurds and then handed over to US custody in October last year. They are still being held at a US facility overseas.

这个承诺是在美国总检察长 William Barr，致英国内政大臣 Priti Patel 的一封信中作出的。此时在去年十月被 Syrian Kurds 逮捕并转送至美国押守的，英国 Isis 的披头士团成员 Alexanda Kotey 和 El Shafee Elsheikh，他们仍然被拘留在一处美国海外设施中。

Barr’s offer came with an ultimatum: if the UK failed to hand over evidence in the case by 15 October, the two detainees would be handed over to the Iraqi justice system.

Barr 的最终通牒：如果英国不在 10 月 15 之前转交证据，两名被拘留者将会被移交至伊拉克司法系统。

“Further delay is no longer possible if Kotey and Elsheikh are to be tried in the United States, and the further delay is an injustice to the families of the victims,” Barr said in the letter to Patel, which has been seen by the Guardian. “Kotey and Elsheikh are currently held by United States military authorities in an overseas theater of military operations, and it is not tenable to continue holding them there for an extended period. Final decisions must be made about this matter.”

“如果 Kotey 和 Elsheikh 要在美国被审判，那么再也不能继续拖延下去了。并且拖延也是一种对受害者亲属的不公平。”Barr 在给 Patel 的信中说到，而卫报也见到了这封信。“Kotey 和 Elsheikh 目前被美国军事当局拘留在海外的军事行动设施中，并且继续保留他们一段额外的时间显然是站不住脚的。这件事必须要做出最终决定了。”

British cooperation with the US prosecution had been blocked under a ruling by the UK supreme court in March, and is still in effect, UK officials pointed out.

英国官方指出，在英国最高法院三月颁布并且至今依然生效的一条法令下，英国和美国起诉方的合作是被禁止的。

“The government’s priority has always been to protect national security and to deliver justice for the victims and their families,” a UK Home Office spokesperson said. “We continue to work closely with international partners to ensure that those who have committed crimes in the name of Daesh [Isis] are brought to justice.”

“政府一直以保护国家安全优先，并且也会给受害者和他们的家属带来正义。”一个英国内政发言人说到，“我们将继续和国际伙伴密切合作，以确保以 Daesh Isis 之名犯罪的人将会被绳之以法。”

Kotey and Elsheikh were part of a group of four who are accused of being involved in the filmed beheadings of two British aid workers, David Haines and Alan Henning, as well as of two US journalists, James Foley and Steven Sotloff.

Kotey 和 Elsheikh 是一个四人团队的成员。这个团队被指控参与了——两名英国救助工人，David Haines 和 Alan Henning，和两名美国记者 James Foley 和 Steven Sotloff——的摄像斩首行动。

The group’s leader, Mohammed Emwazi, was killed in a US drone strike in 2015, while another, Aine Davis, was caught in Turkey and jailed for more than seven years in 2017 for membership of a terrorist organisation.

这个团队的首领，Mohanmmed Emwazi，在 2015 年被美国的无人机击杀，而另一个首领 Aine Davis，因加入恐怖组织，在 2017 年被土耳其逮捕并且被判入狱 7 年以上。

Nicholas Henin, a former French Isis hostage, welcomed the news that the death penalty would be dropped, saying on Twitter it was “great news that opens the way for a trial in the US”.

Nicholas Henin，一个曾被法国 Isis 劫持的人质，对这个死刑将被执行的消息感到开心，他在推特上说到：“这是一个为美国审判开辟了新道路的伟大新闻。”
