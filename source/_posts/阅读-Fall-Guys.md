# Fall Guys: Fortnite meets It's a Knockout in UK video game hit
《糖豆人》：堡垒之夜遇见了来自英国游戏业的“It's a Knockout”的冲击

Fat little jelly beans playing a **neon-coloured** version of the **cult** classic gameshow Takeshi’s Castle might not sound like the British answer to the craze that is Fortnite, but tens of millions of people have downloaded the London-made hit Fall Guys in less than a month since its release.

以肥肥点点的糖豆人形象游玩一个霓虹色版本的狂热经典游戏秀 《Takeshi's Castle》，这可能听起来不像英国人对堡垒之夜热潮的有力武器。但是在其发行了不超过一个月的情况下，超千万的玩家已经下载了这个伦敦出品的大热门《糖豆人》。

“When you’re designing games you want to give people an experience they’ve never felt before,” says its lead designer, Joe Walsh. “And for us, it was a middle-aged slightly **unwieldy** Japanese businessman, on the sideline of a giant obstacle course that he has absolutely no right attempting.”

“当你正在设计一个游戏时，你会想要它带给人们一种前所未有的体验，”它的首席设计师Joe Walsh说道，“对我们来说，我们想要的体验就是，一个中年的日本商人，笨拙憨憨地跑在一个巨大的四处碰壁的障碍物竞赛的路上。”

The resulting game is a joy. Like its predecessor, it sees a huge number of players competing in ever-smaller numbers to be the last one standing; similar too is its explosion in popularity, becoming the most downloaded game on Sony’s PlayStation Plus (PS+) online service ever, beating Fortnite on Twitch, and gathering celebrity fans too: Manchester City’s Sergio Agüero scoring a goal in one of Fall Guys’ minigames provided an early boost, as did F1 driver Lando Norris.

最终成品游戏是一个欢乐向。就像它的前辈一样，一方面它的每场比赛拥有数量众多的玩家同时竞争，随着存留人数越来越少，最终留下最后一个赢家。另一方面，它也是在玩家数上有着爆炸式的增长，直接成为了PS+在线服务有史以来下载最多的游戏，在Twitch上和堡垒之夜同台竞争，并且也收获了众多名人簇拥：曼城的Sergio Agüero 在《糖豆人》早期的小游戏中进了的那个球，给这个游戏带来了早期的爆发。F1赛手Lando Norris也是一样。

But where most popular “Battle Royale” games are fundamentally a **vicious**, weapons-**laden** contest to kill or be killed, Fall Guys has carved its own niche. Players are thrown into a series of mini games straight out of the team’s gameshow inspiration – or, for older readers, the inflatable-filled obstacle courses of It’s a Knockout.

虽然最热门的“大逃杀”游戏都是基于一个狠毒的、全副武装的互相击杀的竞赛，《糖豆人》在其中找到了自己的细分市场。玩家们被扔进一系列的迷你游戏中——这是来自那个游戏秀的直接灵感。或者对年长的读者来说，这个充气式障碍竞赛更像是来自于《It's a Knockout》。

Each round, the worst players are eliminated, perhaps for falling off the rotating **cylinder**, failing to run a gauntlet of **see-saws** fast enough, or being a member of the team which has gathered the fewest eggs in a life-size version of Hungry Hungry Hippos.

每一轮，表现最差的玩家都会被淘汰。可能是因为从圆筒上滚落，可能是因为没有足够快的通过跷跷板，又或者是因为他的团队在真人版的《Hungry Hungry Hippos》中收集了最少的蛋。

Crucially, whether you win or lose, the experience is **hilarious**. Much of the credit goes to the **eponymous** Fall Guys themselves – though better known by the community as “Jelly Beans”. Squat little ovoids, their design was planned from the ground up for physical comedy, Walsh says. “Having little legs is funnier, because they fall over; having big arms is funnier because they throw them in the air as they get hit by something and go flying. They need to be **padded** so that they **bounce**, because bouncing stuff is funnier.”

最重要的一点，不论你赢了还是输了，这场体验都是欢快的。【大部分的赞扬都给到了同名的“Fall Guys”——尽管在圈子中它更多被叫做《糖豆人》】。矮小的蛋形，他们的设计是以物理搞笑为目的从头开始的。Walsh说道：“小短腿会很有意思，因为他们会摔翻天；有个大大的胳膊也好玩，这样他们被啥东西打上天之后可以飞起来。他们应该是被填充了的，这样他们走起来就是蹦蹦哒哒的，而且这样很好笑。”

Created by just 48 people, largely from developer Mediatonic’s London studios, the game was nearly thrown off course by the Covid lockdown, which forced staff home just as the two-year development was reaching its crucial final stages. But they **persevered**, and when the game launched in early August, had high hopes.

仅由48人开发，大部分是Mediatonic的伦敦工作室的开发者的这个游戏，在新冠封锁期间几乎被搁置了。因为新冠期间强制在家办公，而此时这个长达两年的开发正在它最紧要的冲刺阶段。但是他们坚持了下来，并且当这个游戏在八月早期正式发售的时候，他们有着很高的期望。

The game had been selected by Sony for free distribution on PS+, a £50-a-year subscription service, which would hopefully push it over a crucial barrier for any multiplayer experience: ensuring enough players are actually online for people to find a match. Beyond that, though, was a mystery. “We were hopeful that if we could get, I think, maybe 100,000 sales that would be considered a great success,” Walsh says. “And now we’re into multiple millions.”

这个游戏被索尼的PS+免费分发选中了——PS+是一个50英镑一年的订阅服务，而这被寄希望让这个游戏度过每个多人游戏最至关重要的困难：确保有足够多的玩家在线匹配。【除此之外，还有一个奇怪的地方。】“我们当初期望有，大概100000份的销量，这已经算是一个巨大的成功了。”Walsh说道，“然而现在我们已经翻了百万倍。”

With that success has come problems, some difficult for a small team to handle. “We knew that probably our first weekend after launch was going to be the critical weekend,” Walsh says, “and we had plans for how many people we thought we were going to have.” But by the Monday before that, they were already seeing triple the players they had hoped for, sparking a mad rush to try and ensure their servers could keep up with the inflated demand. In the end, they managed to ensure that the game was working more than 90% of the time in that crucial first week.

成功了，问题也随之而来，而且是一些小团队很难解决的问题。“我们知道在发行一周后的首个周末可能将会是一个生死攸关的周末。”Walsh说道，“并且我们根据我们大概会有多少玩家进行了相应的规划。”但是在此之前的周一，他们已经看到了三倍期望的玩家数，于是点燃了一股疯劲努力确保服务器能够跟得上膨胀的需求。在最终，他们设法确保了在这个至关重要的首周游戏能够正确运行超过90%的时间。

The massive success also brought unexpected demands. The team had long planned for players to be able to buy **outfits** to dress their beans up in – a standard **monetisation** technique for multiplayer games – but the success on social media prompted a **deluge** of requests from brands for sponsorship. Instead of going the profitable route, the team opened up one costume slot for **auction** for charity; the contest, which ends on Monday, has so far raised more than $420,000 for the accessibility charity Special Effect.

这个超大的成功也带来了没考虑过的需求。团队有着长期的运营计划，以使玩家可以买服装打扮他们的小人——这是一个标准的多人游戏营利手段——但是由于在社交媒体上的爆火，品牌商蜂拥而至想要赞助。与走向利益最大化的路线相反，团队开放了一个慈善拍卖的插件；在周一结束的比赛中，已经为无障碍慈善“Special Effect”筹集了超过420,000 美元。

Getting to the top is one thing, staying there is another, and Mediatonic has a long road ahead to provide enough regular new content to stay current in the minds of **fickle** gamers. But for now, Walsh is happy with his team’s achievements: “Good, wholesome British comedy, on a scale that has brought a lot of joy, a lot of colour and a lot of **distraction** to people’s lives.”

到达巅峰是一方面，能保持在巅峰则是另一方面。Mediatonic还有很长的路要走，他们要提供足够多的定期更新的新内容来留住现在这些善变的玩家的心。“很棒，健康的英国喜剧，某种程度上来说给人们的生活带来了无数的欢乐、色彩、波澜。”
