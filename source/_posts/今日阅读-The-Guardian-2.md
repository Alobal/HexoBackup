中国泛洪：水漫大佛像，十万余人撤离。

However, the worst of the flooding appeared to be over in Sichuan by Wednesday when the emergency level was lowered and the toes of a famous **Buddhist** statue **re-emerged** as waters receded.

然而，到了周三洪泛最恶劣的阶段似乎快要结束了。此时紧戒等级降低，并且随着退水大佛像的脚趾也重现露了出来。

Sichuan, through which the Yangtze river flows, raised its emergency response to the maximum level on Tuesday to **cope with** a new round of **torrential** rainfall.

长江流经的四川，在周二将它的紧急相应等级提到了最高，以应付新一轮的暴雨。

The Yangtze water resources commission, the government body that oversees the river, declared a red alert late on Tuesday, saying water at some monitoring stations was expected to **exceed “guaranteed” flood protection levels by more than 5 metres.**

Water inflows at the Three Gorges project, a major **hydroelectric** facility designed in part to **tame** floods on the Yangtze, rose to a record 72,000 cubic meters (2.5 million cubic feet) per second on Wednesday, state media said. The inflow was expected to peak on Thursday at 76,000 cubic meters per second, the ministry of water resources said.

The project restricts the amount of water flowing downstream by storing it in its **reservoir**, which has been more than 10 metres higher than its official warning level for more than a month.

这个工程通过在水库蓄水限制了下游的水流量，而水库水位在至少一个月的时间里超出了官方警戒线十米以上。
