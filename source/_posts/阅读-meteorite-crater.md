# Massive meteorite crater found in Western Australia thought to be 100 million years old

在澳大利亚西部找到的超大陨石坑被认为有 1 亿年历史

A massive 100 million-year-old meteorite crater has been found while a company was drilling for gold in **outback** Western Australia.

在一个公司在澳大利亚西部的内陆钻探黄金时，发现了一个大规模的一亿年历史的陨石坑。

The impact crater is **estimated** to have a **diameter** of about 5km. Although not visible from the surface, experts found the crater using electromagnetic surveys.

据估计这个冲击坑直径有大约 5km 长。尽管从表明看不到它，专家们还是利用了电磁探测装置找到了这个坑。

Located near the Goldfields mining town of Ora Banda, north-west of Kalgoorlie-Boulder, the crater is believed to be five times bigger than the famous Wolfe Creek crater in the Kimberley.

陨石坑位于 Kalgoorlie-Boulder 的西北部，Ora Banda 的一个金矿镇附近。与之前著名的 Kimberley 的 Wolfe Creek 比起来，它被认为超前者五倍大。

The geologist and **geophysicist**, Dr Jayson Meyers, said the find was significant and unexpected.

地理学家和地球物理学家，Jayson Meyers 博士说道，这个发现是意义重大且意料之外的。

“This discovery was made in an area where the landscape is very flat. You wouldn’t know it was there because the crater has been filled in over geological time,” he said.

“这个坑是在一个非常平坦的区域发现的。你根本想象不到它在那，因为随着地质学时间的飞逝它已经被填充了。”他说道。

The crater was discovered on land owned by Australia’s third-largest gold-mining company, Evolution Mining.

陨石坑是被澳大利亚的第三大金矿公司，Evolution Mining，在陆地上发现的。

With a diameter of 5km, the Ora Banda crater is thought to be one of the largest meteorite craters in the world.

由于有着 5km 的直径 ，Ora Banda 的陨石坑被认为是世界上最大的陨石坑之一。

Using modern techniques, such as gravity surveying, geologists were able to map out the crater and Meyers thinks their successful find will lead to more discoveries.

运用现代科技，例如重力勘测，地质学家能够标记出陨石坑的位置，并且 Meyers 认为这个成功的探测会是更多发现的一个开头。

“There’s probably quite a few more out there,” he said. “We’ve probably been hit by more **asteroids** than we thought. If we start recognising more of these, then the landscape begins changing, and we have to ask ourselves what’s the frequency and why are they happening?”

“那儿很可能有着更多，”他说道，“地球已经被超乎想象的多的小行星砸中过了。如果我们对此想的更远一些，【那么视角就会开始不一样了】，我们必须问自己撞击频率是怎么样的，并且为什么会发生这种事？”

Meyers said more discoveries could help scientists better predict when a meteorite may next strike Earth.

Meyers 说更多的发现将帮助科学家们更好地预测何时一个陨石可能撞击地球。

“If we can understand more of the geological history, we can predict when the next event will happen, or see when another rogue asteroid could hit us.”

“如果我们理解更多的地质历史，我们能预测下一次大事变会是什么时候，或者知道什么时候下一个陨石会袭击我们。”

Close inspections of drilling samples included **telltale** signs of a meteorite strike, including “shatter cones”, which are known to form in the **bedrock** below craters or underground nuclear explosions.

钻探样本的分析结果包含着陨石撞击的视觉信息，包含了“破裂锥”，而这是由陨石坑之下的基岩或者地下核爆炸形成。

Meyers **hypothesises** the meteorite had to have been quite large in diameter to cause such an impact.

Meyers 假设陨石应该有一个很大的直径才能造成这样的冲击。

“To cause an impact of that size, the asteroid would’ve been approximately 100-200 metres in diameter, so it was a pretty big rock that came sailing into our planet. The ground was actually pushed down from the pressure, but then the Earth rebounded, almost like a **spring**. It bounced back up.”

“为了造成这种规模的冲击，小行星应该大概有 100-200 米的直径。【所以它应该是一个很大的飞进我们星球的石头。】整个地面实际上都被压力压下去了，但是之后地球反弹了起来，就像一个弹簧。它反弹了回去。”

Scientists discovered the world’s oldest meteorite crater in Western Australia’s mid-west earlier this year.

科学家们今年早些在西澳大利亚的中西部发现了这个世界最老的陨石坑。

The Yarrabubba crater, located near Meekatharra in WA’s mid-west, was found to be around 2.23 billion years old. That makes it over 200 million years older than the next oldest crater.

Yarrabubba 陨石坑，位于西澳大利亚中西部的 Meekatharra 附近。它被发现有着 22.3 亿年的历史。这比起次老的陨石坑超了约 2 亿年。
