# Getting ahead isn't a nasty business, US study reveals
美国研究表明，出人头地并不非要当个混蛋。

The question has puzzled humans from the earliest philosophers to the ranks of home workers who have swapped water cooler **gossip** for **rants** on Zoom: does being a **jerk** help people get to the top?

有个问题一直困扰着最早的一批哲学家，并且也困扰着在 Zoom 上把闲谈八卦转换为怒吼的在家办公人员：变成一个混蛋能够变得杰出吗？

Now, after a study lasting more than a decade, researchers believe they finally have the answer. Nasty colleagues are no more likely to reach positions of power than those who are nice, they conclude.

如今通过一个持续长达十多年的研究，研究者们认为他们找到了答案。他们得出结论，比起友好的同事，令人讨厌的同事不存在接触权力位置的优势。

“Disagreeable people – selfish, bullying, nasty people – did not attain power any more in their careers than nice, generous, caring people,” said Cameron Anderson, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley. “Being a jerk simply didn’t help people attain higher power.”

“讨嫌的人——自私，霸道，令人厌恶的人——比起友好，慷慨，善于关心的人，并不会在事业中获得更多的权力。”Cameron Anderson 说道，他是一位 Berkeley 的 California 大学 Haas 商学院的教授。“当个混蛋根本做不了大事。”

Anderson and his colleagues **delved** into the issue because aggressive, selfish and **manipulative** people can create a **toxic** work environment and cause businesses to fail. They can also give people the wrong impression of the attributes that seed success. Writing in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, they note one **take-home message** from a popular biography of Steve Jobs, the former Apple CEO, was: “Maybe if I become an even bigger asshole I’ll be successful like Steve.”

因为盛气凌人的、自私的、控制欲的人总是会带来极其恶劣的工作环境，并且最终导致任务失败。因此 Anderson 和他的同事对上述情况进行了钻研。那种人还会给人们带来错误的印象——好像为了成功就需要这样糟糕的人格。在美国国家科学院院刊中写到，他们备注了一条来自前苹果 CEO，Steve Jobs 的热门传记中的核心观点：“假如我变成了一个更坏的混蛋，说不定我也会像乔布斯一样成功。”

To find out whether nasty people really did fare better at work, the researchers invited 671 US students to take personality tests between 1999 and 2008. Disagreeable people tend to behave in **quarrelsome**, cold and selfish ways, and the **trait** is reasonably stable throughout life.

为了探究到底混蛋能否在工作中表现的更好，研究者们在 1999 到 2008 之间邀请了 671 名学生进行人格测试。讨人嫌的人倾向于表现地更易争吵、冷漠、自私。并且这些特征在生活中都合理地稳定。

Anderson then went back to the volunteers, on average about 14 years later, when most were well into their careers. He quizzed them on their workplace, the position they held, and what power they held in the company. **Crucially**, he also asked hundreds of co-workers to share their own thoughts on the volunteers.

Anderson 在平均 14 年后，重新去找到这些志愿者，他们之中大部分都有不错的职业生涯。他对他们进行了一些调查测试，关于他们的工作环境，他们的工作地位，以及拥有的公司权力。至关重要的是，他也循环了数百名他们的同事来分享他们对这些志愿者的私人看法。

Contrary to Anderson’s expectations, the study showed that nice people reached positions of power just as much as nasty people, regardless of the organisation they worked in. “It would make sense if disagreeable people had an advantage in organisations that are more cut-throat and competitive, where everyone is looking out for her/himself,” he said. “But we didn’t find that.” In fact, being nasty did not seem to help anyone in any setting.

和 Anderson 的预期相反的是，研究表明，与工作组织无关，好人能接触到的权力和混蛋几乎是一样多的。“假如混蛋在那种竞争性强的团队中有优势是比较合理的，毕竟那里人人都只是为自己着想。”他说，“但我们没有发现这种现象。”事实上，当个混蛋在任何环境下都不能帮助任何人。

The research revealed that while nasty people displayed more aggressive behaviour, which could help them climb the corporate **ladder**, bad relationships with their colleagues appeared to cancel out any benefits.

研究表明，尽管混蛋们表现地更加有侵略性，而这可以帮助他们攀爬事业阶梯，然而与同事的恶劣关系把所有好处都抵消了。

All of which has made Anderson happy. “I was relieved and **heartened** that disagreeableness had no effect. Especially because my students consistently bring up examples of powerful people who are jerks, for example the late Steve Jobs, and argue that bullying and selfishness must be necessary to be powerful. This study will help me argue against that commonly held myth.”

这一切研究结果让Anderson感到开心。“我终于松了一口气，并且很高兴看到讨人嫌是没有任何帮助的，尤其是当我的学生连续不断地举了一些杰出的人都是混蛋的例子时，例如晚年乔布斯，并且他们还辩论到霸道和自私是成功的必要条件。这项研究可以让我很好的反驳这个流传广泛的谣言。”
