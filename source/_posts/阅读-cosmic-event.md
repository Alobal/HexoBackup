# 'It just sounds like a thud': astronomers hear biggest **cosmic** event since big bang

“就像雷鸣一样”：天文学家听到了自宇宙大爆炸以来最大的宇宙事件

Scientists have announced the detection of a signal from a long-ago collision between two black holes that created a new one of a size never seen before.

科学家们宣布检测到了一个来自远古的两个黑洞的碰撞信号，这个碰撞创造了一个前所未有的尺寸的新黑洞。

"It’s the biggest bang since the big bang observed by humanity," said Caltech professor of physics Alan Weinstein, who was part of the discovery team.

“这是人类观测到的自宇宙大爆炸以来最大的一次冲击，”勘测团队中的一员，Caltech 物理教授 Alan Weinstein 说道。

Black holes are **compact** regions of space so densely packed that not even light can escape them. Until now, astronomers only had observed them in two general sizes: “small” ones called **stellar** black holes that are formed when a star collapses and are about the size of small cities, and supermassive black holes that are millions, perhaps billions, of times more massive than our sun and around which entire galaxies revolve.

黑洞是空间紧凑的区域，紧凑到以至于光都不能从黑洞逃离。直到今天，天文学家们仅仅观测到两种通常的尺寸：小号的，被叫做恒星黑洞，形成于一个星球的塌缩，大小大约是小型城市的大小。超大规模黑洞则是比我们的太阳大了百万倍，甚至有十亿倍，并且整个星系都会围绕着其旋转。

According to astronomers’ calculations, anything in between didn’t quite make sense, because stars that grew too big before collapse would essentially consume themselves, leaving no black hole.

根据天文学家的计算，在两者之间的任何尺寸实际上都意义不大。因为在塌缩之前变得太大的星球，在本质上会消解它们自己，不会留下任何黑洞。

Star collapses could not create stellar black holes much bigger than 70 times the mass of our sun, scientists thought, according to physicist Nelson Christensen, research director of the Artemis research unit at the French National Centre for Scientific Research.

据法国国家科学研究院的阿耳忒弥斯研究所的研究主任，物理学家 Nelson Christensen——科学家们认为星球塌缩至多不会产生超过太阳 70 倍大小的恒星级黑洞。

Then in May 2019 two detectors picked up a signal that turned out to be the energy from two stellar black holes — each large for a stellar black hole — crashing into each other. One was 66 times the mass of our sun and the other 85 times its mass. The result was the first known intermediate black hole, at 142 times the mass of the sun.

之后在 2019 年 5 月，两个检测器检测到了一个信号，并且最终发现是两个恒星级黑洞产生的能量——两者大小都和恒星级黑洞相当——撞向了对方。一个是 66 倍太阳质量，另一个是 85 倍太阳质量。最终它们产生了一个人类第一次已知的中间尺寸黑洞，大约是 142 倍太阳质量。

Lost in the collision was an enormous amount of energy in the form of a gravitational wave, a **ripple** in space that travels at the speed of light. It was that wave that physicists in the US and Europe, using detectors called LIGO and Virgo, captured last year. After **deciphering** the signal and checking their work, the scientists published the results on Wednesday in the journals Physical Review Letters and Astrophysical Journal Letters.

在碰撞中，由于引力波的形成而损失了大量的能量，引力波即是一个光速传播的空间波纹。它就是那个在欧美的物理学家们，利用叫做 LIGO 和 Virgo 的监测装置，于去年检测到的波动。在破译信号并且检查之后，在周三，科学家们在 the journals Physical Review Letters 和 Astrophysical Journal Letters 上公开了研究成果。

Because the detectors allow scientists to pick up the gravitational waves as audio signals, scientists actually heard the collision. For all the violence and drama, the signal lasted only a tenth of a second. "It just sounds like a thud,” Weinstein said. “It really doesn’t sound like much on a speaker."

因为检测器可以让科学家们将引力波看作音频信号，科学家们实际上是听到了那场碰撞。【对于所有的声音】，信号只持续了十分之一秒。“听起来就像雷鸣，”Weinstein 说道，【“在扬声器声听起来也不是很像。”】

This crash happened about 7 bn years ago, when the universe was half its current age, but is only being detected now because it happened so far away.

这场碰撞发生在大约 70 亿年前，当时宇宙还是如今一半的年龄。但因为它实在是在太远的地方发生了，只有到了现在才可以检测到。

Black hole collisions have been observed before, but the black holes involved were smaller to begin with, and even after the merger didn’t grow beyond the size of typical stellar black holes.

之前也观测过黑洞碰撞，但是所涉及的黑洞一开始都是较小的，而且就算是融合后的尺寸也没有超过典型的恒星级黑洞。

Scientists still don’t know how supermassive black holes at the centre of galaxies formed, Christensen said, but this new discovery may offer a clue.

科学家们仍然不知道银河系中心的超大黑洞是如何形成的，Christensen 说道，但是如今的新发现可能可以提供一些线索。

It may be that smaller blocks combine to make bigger ones and those combine to make even bigger ones, said Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb, who wasn’t part of the study but said the results **chart** new astronomical **territory**.

可能是由小的结合成大的，再结合成更大的，Havard 天文学家 Avi Loeb 说道。他不是研究团队的一员，但是他把结果制成了新的天文版图。

Indeed, the larger of the two black holes involved in this crash may have been the result of an earlier merger, both Weinstein and Christensen said.

确切来说，碰撞中两个黑洞较大的那一个，可能就是一场更早的融合的产物，Weinstein 和 Christensen 都这么认为。

"It’s **conceivable** that this pair of black holes formed entirely differently, possibly in a dense system with lots of dead stars **whizzing** about, which allows one black hole to capture another during a fly-by," said Barnard College astronomer Janna Levin, author of the book Black Hole Survival Guide.

“可以想象，这对黑洞形成方式完全不同。可能是在一个稠密的众多死星流落的星系中，一个黑洞捕获了另一个经过的黑洞。”Barnard 大学的天文学家 Janna Levin 说道，他也是《Black Hole Survival Guide》的作者。

On the other hand, scientists can’t quite explain how merged black holes, flying around the universe, would meet so many others to merge again and grow ever bigger. It could instead be that supermassive black holes were formed in the immediate **aftermath** of the big bang.

另一方面，科学家们还无法很好地解释，【在宇宙中飞行的融合黑洞，怎么遇到如此多的其他黑洞并且不停地融合变大。】因此相反，超大规模黑洞也可能是大爆炸瞬间的产物。

"In astrophysics, we’re always faced with surprises," Weinstein said.

“在天文学，我们总是能有惊喜。”Weinstein 说道。
