# Winds fuel wildfires in California as blazes rage across US west
加州风燃野火，美国西部火灾肆虐

![加州大火](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9eac650ea9b614ab4f67ef62a1a156e5b415fc19/0_299_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=700&quality=45&auto=format&fit=max&dpr=2&s=89029d62987a25df3294b21a6cef66e0)

Large, fast-moving fires **raged** on across the American west on Wednesday, destroying hundreds of homes in the Pacific north-west and sending a dense **plume** of smoke that turned skies **amber** across parts of the region.

周三，大规模的、扩散迅速的火灾在美国西部肆虐。火灾摧毁了太平洋西北部地区上百的房屋，并且生成了一股浓烟，以至于把这片地区的天空染成了琥珀色。

More than 85 significant wildfires are burning across the west. In California, high, dry winds stoked dozens of out-of-control blazes that have forced helicopter rescues and evacuations. In Washington, more acres burned in a single day than firefighters usually see all year, and the fires **scorched** farming town of Malden. Fires also forced people to flee in Oregon and Idaho.

整个西部发生了超过 85 起严重的野外火灾。在加利福尼亚，高空干燥的大风燃起了数十起难以控制的火灾，以至于需要利用直升机进行救援和疏散。在华盛顿，消防员见过的单日燃烧面积比以往都要多。并且火灾把 Malden 的农场燃烧殆尽。火灾也迫使在 Oregon 和 Idaho 的人们流离失所。

“The geographic scale and intensity of what is **transpiring** is truly **jarring**,” wrote Daniel Swain, a **climate** scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles.

“从地理学的角度，这次火灾的严重程度是让人震撼的，”洛杉矶的加州大学气候学家 Daniel Swain 写道。

“What’s remarkable is that there’s so many fires,” said Chris Field, who directs the Stanford Woods **Institute** for the Environment. “Even as someone whose job is to understand what’s happening, it’s really hard to keep up.”

“特别是，发生了这么多起火灾。”斯坦福森林环境研究所的所长 Chris Field 说道。“就算有人专职去了解发生了什么，也根本跟不上事情的发展。”

In California, the Bear fire, which began in a remote northern region not far from the town of Paradise, expanded by about a quarter-million acres over a 24-hour period. The blaze threatened the town of Oroville, where **residents** are under evacuation warnings just three years after they were evacuated when heavy rains damaged the huge Oroville dam.

在加州，熊熊烈焰燃于一个距天堂镇东部不远的一个偏远地区，然后在 24 小时之内扩大了大约 25 万英亩。火焰让 Oroville 小镇的人们恐慌。那儿的居民在三年前因大雨摧毁了大 Oroville 堤坝而被迫疏散，三年后又处于疏散警告当中。

A vast cloud of smoke covered much of California on Wednesday, dimming the sun to an **eerie** orange **glow** in **swathes** of the region. “Smoke particles scatter blue light and only allow yellow-orange-red light to reach the surface, causing skies to look orange,” the Bay Area Air District said on Twitter.

周三，一大股烟云遮蔽了加州大部分地区，甚至把大片地区的阳光染成了诡异的橘黄色。“烟雾粒子散射了蓝光，并且只允许黄-橘-红色的光到达地球表面，因此天空看起来就变橙色了。”海湾航空区在推特上说道。

In Oregon, wildfires covering some 375,000 acres were distributed in complexes throughout the entire length of Cascade Mountains, with many moving quickly towards its most populous cities. Blazes also sprung up in other forested areas in the state’s western third. Although no deaths had been confirmed by emergency services by Wednesday afternoon, in a **press conference**, Governor Kate Brown told Oregonians to prepare for what could be “the greatest loss of life and structures due to wildfire in state history”.

在 Oregon，影响了约 375000 英亩的野火纷杂地分布在 Cascade 山脉的全长中，并且其中有很多起火灾朝着其人口最稠密的城市蔓延。火焰也在这个州的西部三分之一地区的森林区域出现。尽管由于周三下午的紧急行动目前没有死亡案例，在一场新闻发布会上，Governor Kate Brown 告诉 Oregon 人做好心理准备，这将会是“整个州历史上死亡最多损失最大的野火。”

By Wednesday afternoon, parts of at least seven counties were subject to evacuation orders, in communities scattered across the length of the state, from the southern border to the Portland suburbs. These evacuations included much of the southern city of Medford (population 82,000), half of Clackamas county, which **comprises** the south-eastern part of the Portland metropolitan area, and parts of Washington county, on the city’s west.

到周三下午，至少七个县的部分地区被下达了疏散令。这些地区分布从南部边界到波特兰教区，遍布整个州。【这些疏散包括了 Medford（人口 82000）的南部城市的大多数，Clackamas 县的半数，其中包括波特兰市区的东南部，以及华盛顿县的西部的部分地区。】

The wholly uncontained Santiam fire, meanwhile, had burned over 159,000 acres by Wednesday, had forced evacuations in several small mountain communities, and sent thick smoke over the state capital, Salem, turning skies in the city blood red. As **stretched** fire crews struggled to contain the flames, three prisons in Oregon were evacuated on Tuesday night.

期间完全控制不住的圣地亚哥大火，直到周三已经燃烧了超过 159000 英亩。迫使了数个小山区进行疏散，并且在州首府燃起了稀薄的烟雾，把天空染成了血红色。随着【大批】消防人员努力控制火势，Oregon 的三个监狱得以在周二晚进行疏散。

Throughout the region, firefighters have been racing to contain an **onslaught** of fire. The El Dorado fire in California’s San Bernardino national forest had spread across 11,259 acres and was 19% contained on Wednesday. The day before, 14 firefighters were trapped, suffering burns. Three were critically injured, and are being treated at a hospital in Fresno, the US Forest Service said.

在整个地区，消防员一直都在努力和猛烈火势作斗争。在加州 San Bernardino 国家森林 El Dorado 火灾已经扩散到了 11259 英亩，并且在周三有 19%的火势被控制了。这天之前，14 名消防员被困被烧。美国林业局称，有三名消防员严重烧伤，并且现在在 Fresno 的医院中接受治疗。

The Creek fire, in the Sierra national forest, remained out of control, growing to nearly 153,000 acres and **spurring** the evacuation of more than 30,000 people in Madera and Fresno counties. The fire left dozens of campers and hikers **stranded** at the Vermilion Valley Resort, after the only road, snaking along a steep cliff, was closed on Sunday.

在 Sierra 国家森林的 Creek 大火，还是处于难以控制的状态，已经扩散到了 153000 英亩，并且促使了在 Madera 和 Fresno 多县的超过 30000 人的疏散行动。在周日，随着火灾使得 Vermilion Valley Resort 的唯一一条蜿蜒悬崖小道被封锁，数十名露营者和远足者被困在了里面。

A dramatic temperature **plunge**, caused by an **intrusion** of polar air, helped slow wildfires in Colorado and Montana. Temperatures in Denver fell from over 100F (37.8C) on Saturday to 33F (0.6C) on Tuesday. **Searing** temperatures and orange, fire-tinged skies gave way to snow overnight, prompting Scott Dennings, a climate scientist at Colorado State University, to caption before and after photos with a Robert Frost poem: “Some say the world will end in fire, / Some say in ice.”

由于极地空气的入侵，一场突如其然的温度暴跌，有效减缓了 Colorado 和 Montana 的火势。在周二，Denver 的温度从 100F（37.8℃）跌倒了 33F（0.6℃）。灼热的温度和火染的天空在一夜之间下起了雪。这使得 Colorado 州大学的环境科学家 Scott Dennings 给前后的照片加了个 Robert Frost 的诗作为抬头：“Some say the world will end in fire, / Some say in ice.”

Although landscapes in California and much of the west are adapted to fire, global heating is driving more frequent and extreme fires. The massive flames across the region are alarming, and **unprecedented**, “What we’ve been experiencing, we’ve been expecting,” Field said. Climate change has given rise to fires that behave differently, burn more intensely and explosively and “are just harder for firefighters to fight”.

尽管加利福尼亚的山水和绝大部分西部地区都适应了火灾，但是全球变暖还是带来了越来越多的大型火灾。在这整片区域的前所未有的大规模火灾让人震惊，“咎由自取” Filed 说道，气候改变使火灾变得不太一样，火势更大、而且更具有爆发性，并且“对消防员来说很难扑灭”。

Decades of fire suppression – wherein the US government put out wildfires that were beneficial to the landscape – have also driven larger blazes. The government also **criminalized** the Indigenous practice of setting small intentional burns to clear out brush and prevent more damaging, destructive burns. “The way we are interacting with the ecosystems across the west is dramatically different now,” Field said.

数十年的火势抑制——数十年间美国政府总是扑灭对于环境有益的野外火灾——也让如今的火势变得更大。政府还把土著人故意引起小火灾清楚灌木丛，从而阻止更大更危险的火灾发生的行为定为犯罪。

The wildfires this week came as the region suffers its second historic heatwave since August and widespread drought has dried out vegetation.

这个星期，随着这个地区引来了它自八月以来第二高温的热浪，火灾再次发生了，并且随之大面积的干旱使植物完全枯死。

California registered its first large fires this summer in mid-August, weeks ahead of peak fire season in the state, which comes in the autumn, when powerful offshore winds have stoked some of the state’s biggest, most dangerous blazes. The mid-August blazes were triggered by heat and a highly unusual **bout** of dry lightning.

加州记载了它在这个夏季的八月中旬的最大的一场火，就在这个州的野火季几周前。野火季一般是在秋季，这时离岸向海的强风会燃起这个州最大最具危险的火灾。八月中的火灾是被温度和一阵高强度的不同寻常的干燥闪电。

“The word ‘historic’ is a term we use often in the state of California, but these numbers bear fruit,” Gavin Newsom, the state’s governor, said on Tuesday, calling the challenge ahead “extraordinary”.

“ ‘historic’这个词是一个在加州经常用得到的词，【并且这些数字也适合这个词。】”周二，州长 Gavin Newsom 说道，并且把将迎来的挑战称之为“无与伦比的”。

“I have no patience for climate change deniers,” Newsom said. “That view is completely inconsistent with the reality on the ground, and the facts of our experiences. You may not believe it, but our own experiences tell a different story here in the state of California.”

“对于拒绝承认气候变化的人，我没有任何耐心，” Newsom 说道，“这副景观是的的确确和现实完全不一样，和我们的经验完全不一样。你可能不相信气候变化，但是此时此地加州的我们用经历告诉了你这个完全不一样的故事。”
