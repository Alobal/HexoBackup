# Ten in remote Indian tribe of 59 test positive for Covid-19
在 59 人的印度偏远部落中出现了 10 名新冠测试阳性者。

Ten members of a **dwindling** **tribe** who live on a **secluded** island in the Andaman Islands **archipelago** have tested positive for coronavirus, as the **pandemic** continues to affect even the most remote regions of India.

随着新冠病毒持续在印度大流行，甚至影响到了其最偏远的地区，在一个 Andaman 群岛中的一个幽僻小岛上，一个逐渐没落的部落也出现了十名阳性测试结果的人。

There are only 59 surviving members of the Great Andamanese tribe, all of them on Strait Island in the Andaman archipelago.

在 the Great Andamanese 部落，仅有 59 名成员生活着。他们所有人都生活在 Andaman 群岛中的 Strait 岛上。

A team of healthcare workers sailed over to the small island last week to carry out tests after six members of the tribe, who had travelled to the region’s capital, Port Blair, for work, tested positive for the virus on the mainland.

在六名因工作曾经去过这个地区的首都——Port Blair，的部落成员在陆地上被检测出病毒阳性特征之后，一组保健工作者，在上周航行到这个小岛上以进行检测。

The samples showed that four other members of the tribe who had never left the island were also infected with the virus.

样本显示，其他四位从来没有离开小岛的部落成员，也一样被病毒感染。

Dr Avijit Roy, a regional senior health director, said the virus had reached the island even though Covid tests were being carried out on every person travelling to any of the 38 inhabited islands.

Dr Avijit Roy，一个地区性高级卫生总监，说尽管对所有曾去过 38 个有人岛屿之一的人都进行了新冠测试，病毒还是抵达了这个岛。

“Over the last few months, every person who has been travelling to these islands, particularly the restricted travel areas, has been tested, but it seems that someone carrying the virus must have gone undetected,” he said.

“在前几个月，所有曾去过这些岛屿的人，特别是去过限制旅行区域的人，都被测试过了。但是看起来还是有某些携带病毒的人没有被检测到。”他说。

On Thursday India reported a record daily tally of 75,760 new coronavirus infections, pushing its total to 3.1 million. There were 1,023 deaths recorded in the same 24-hour period, taking the country’s toll to 60,472.

在周四，印度进行了每日报告——新增 75760 新冠感染，而这表明总感染数已经达到了 310 万。同时这 24 小时中，也新增记录了 1023 名死亡，让这个国家的总死亡数达到了 60472。

While the virus was initially concentrated in India’s densely populated cities such as Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai, it has now spread into rural and isolated communities that have limited healthcare resources. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands, which have a population of 400,000, have reported a total of 2,944 coronavirus cases among the non-tribal population.

尽管病毒最初还只是集中在印度的密集繁华城市，例如 Delhi，Mumbai 和 Chennai。如今它已经扩散进了乡村和孤立社区，而这些地方的保健资源十分有限。有着 400000 人口的 Andaman 和 Nicobar 群岛，报告称在非部落人口中已经出现了总计 2944 名的新冠感染。

The four tribespeople on the island who tested positive were aged between 26 and 55, and all have been taken to hospital as a precautionary measure, though Roy said none showed any severe symptoms. The six who originally tested positive for the virus in Port Blair are under observational home **quarantine**.

那个岛上四名检测阳性的部落人，年龄分布在 26 到 55 之间。尽管 Roy 说没有人表现出任何严重的症状，但作为一种预防措施，还是把他们都送进了医院。而那六名最初在 Port Blair 检测阳性的人，目前在居家隔离观察。

Roy was confident that with continued testing and further restrictions on movement, the Great Andamanese people would remain safe. “All routes of possible transmission are being monitored,” he said. “No one is allowed on to the island until they have been tested negative, and so right now we have ruled out the possibility of new cases.”

Roy 有自信通过在持续的检测和更严格的移动限制下，the Great Andamanese 的人民一定可以保障安全。

Arjun Munda, the union minister of tribal affairs, voiced concern at the Great Andamanese infections and said the government was taking “all precautionary measures” to keep them safe.

Arjun Munda，部落事务联合部长，发声表示了对 the Great Andamanese 的感染情况的关心，并且说政府正在用尽“一切预防措施”来保障他们的安全。

The Great Andamanese are one of five tribes living on the Andaman Islands who are feared to be highly **vulnerable** to the coronavirus pandemic.

the Great Andamanese 是生活在 Andaman 群岛上的五大部落之一，而他们被担心极易受到新冠流行的感染。

In 1788, when the British first tried in vain to **invade** the islands, the Great Andamanese numbered between 5,000 and 8,000, and were made up of 10 different tribes.

在 1788，当英国第一次尝试入侵这些群岛时，the Great Andamanese 人口还在 5000 到 8000 中间，并且时由是个不同的部落组成。

Today there are just over 50 people left, and members from only two of the 10 tribes have survived. Their language has largely been lost – in April this year the last speaker of the Sare Great Andamanese language died from multiple health problems – and the tribe now mostly speaks Hindi.

如今，仅剩下了 50 个人，十个部落中也仅有两个存活了下来。他们的语言已经很大程度上遗失了——在今年四月，the Sare Great Andamanese 语言最后的掌握者死于多项健康疾病——并且部落如今基本都是说印度语。

The **indigenous** Andamanese population has been falling for decades as they have poor immunity to many diseases and have been particularly vulnerable to **tuberculosis** and **alcoholism**.

由于 Andamanese 的原住民缺乏对大多数疾病的免疫能力，他们的人口数十年来都在持续下跌，并且对于酗酒和肺结核来说也十分脆弱。

There are only about 200 surviving members of the Shompen tribe, 150 of the Sentinelese tribe, 100 of the Onge and about 400 of the **nomadic** Jarawa tribe, who have reportedly moved deep into the **jungle** since the outbreak of the pandemic in an attempt to protect themselves.

Shompen 部落目前仅有 200 的存活成员，Sentinelese 部落仅有 150 名，Onge 有 100 名，Jarawa 游牧部落则有大约 400 人。据报道 Jarawa 的人是在病毒大爆发的时候，为了尝试保护他们自己，而迁移到了丛林深处。

The Sentinelese tribe, who are **hostile** to outsiders and made the headlines in 2018 when they shot dead an American missionary, John Allen Chau, with bows and arrows after he travelled to their island, are unlikely to be aware of the coronavirus pandemic.

Sentinelese 部落，是一个对外来者十分敌对的部落。在 2018 他们还因为用弓箭击毙了刚抵达他们岛屿的美国传教士 John Allen Chau 而上了头条新闻。这个部落也不太可能意识到新冠病毒的爆发。

“It is extremely alarming that members of the Great Andamanese tribe tested positive for Covid-19,” said Sophie Grig, a senior researcher with Survival International, an organisation representing tribal people across the world. “They will be all too aware of the devastating impact of **epidemics** that have **decimated** their people.”

“令人相当震惊的时，the Great Andamanese 部落的大部分成员都对 Covid-19 检测为阳性。”Survival International 的一名高级研究员 Sophie Grig 说道。Survival International 是一个代表世界各地部落民族的组织。“他们将对摧毁他们民族的流行病的灾难性冲击很有体会。”
