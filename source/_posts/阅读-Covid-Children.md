# Fatigue and headache most common Covid symptoms in children – study
研究表明，疲劳和头痛是儿童最普遍的新冠感染症状

**Fatigue**, headache and fever are the most common symptoms of coronavirus in children, with few developing a cough or losing their sense of taste or smell, researchers have found, adding to calls for age-specific symptom checklists.

研究者们发现，疲劳、头痛和发烧是儿童感染新冠最普遍的症状，其中也有小部分会演变成咳嗽或者失去嗅觉或味觉。并且他们据此将这些症状添加到了根据年龄定制的症状检测清单中。

The NHS lists three symptoms as signs of Covid-19 in adults and children: a high temperature, a new, continuous cough, and a loss or change in the sense of smell or taste.

NHS列举了三项成人和儿童的感染标志性症状：体温过高，突然的连续不断的咳嗽，和嗅觉或者味觉的变化或缺失。

However, the team behind the Covid symptom study app say new data shows that the disease presents differently in children compared with adults.

然而，在新冠症状学习app背后的团队称，新的数据显示儿童表现的症状和成人有所区别。

“We need to start to telling people what are the key symptoms at different ages rather than this **blanket** **obsession** with fever, cough and lack of smell,” said Prof Tim Spector, of King’s College London, who led the work.

“我们需要告诉人们什么年龄段有着什么样的关键症状，而不是死抓发烧、咳嗽和嗅觉丢失。” app项目的领导者，伦敦国王大学的Prof Tim Spector说道。

The team’s latest findings are based on reports of symptoms among 198 children who tested positive for the disease out of almost 16,000 tested. Crucially, the team note, parents could have tested their children at the same time as they themselves took a test, meaning the children could have been tested even if they had no symptoms.

这个团队最新发现是基于一个调查报告。这个调查在大约16000的儿童中，收集了198名检测阳性的儿童的症状。团队提到，至关重要的是，父母在他们自己进行检测的时候也可以同时给孩子进行检测，这意味儿童即使没有症状也会被检测。

While a third of the children who tested positive showed no symptoms – adding weight to other work showing many infections are **asymptomatic** – the team say those who did showed a different set of symptoms than adults.

三分之一的测试阳性儿童没有任何症状——这表明很多感染是无症状的，给其他工作带来了更多的压力——团队称，他们确实表现除了和成人不一样的感染症状集。

More than half of the Covid-positive children with symptoms – 55% – had fatigue, while 54% had a headache and almost half had a fever. **Sore** throats were present in around 38% of the children with symptoms, while almost 35% skipped meals, 15% had an unusual skin **rash** and 13% had **diarrhoea**.

超过半数的新冠感染儿童有病状——55%，有疲劳症状，另外54%有头痛，并且绝大多数都会有发烧。有38%的有症状儿童呈现了喉咙痛的症状，35%的不想吃饭，15%的有不寻常的皮疹，13%有腹泻。

By contrast, the team has found that the most common symptoms in adults are fatigue, headache, a persistent cough, sore throat and loss of smell.

作为对比，这个团队发现在承认中最普遍的症状是疲劳、头痛、持续的咳嗽、喉咙痛以及嗅觉缺失。

Spector noted that of children who tested positive and had symptoms, around a half didn’t have any of the three main signs listed by the NHS.

Spector指出，有将近一半的检测阳性且有症状的儿童，没有表现出NHS列出的三大主要标志症状中的任何一个。

“If you followed the government’s advice you’d be missing half of the [symptomatic] infections,” he said, adding that teachers and parents needed to be aware that the virus can present differently in children and adults.

“如果你听从政府的建议，你将会错失近半的有症状感染。”他说到。并且补充说老师和父母应该对病毒在成人儿童上有不同的症状而有所警觉。

“What we want to do here is not push [children] to have tests, but just keep them away from school [if they show symptoms],” he said.

“我们目前想要做的不是推动所有儿童去进行检测，而是如果他们有相关症状，则让他们远离校园。”他说道。

While Spector noted some of the symptoms in children overlapped with those for colds, which could become increasingly **problematic** as the winter months approach, other symptoms, such as skin rashes, were unusual. The team have previously argued rashes should be added to the official list of symptoms, noting that they also appear in adults with Covid.

Spector指出儿童身上的一些感染症状和感冒很像，而随着冬季的到来这将越来越成为问题。另外一些症状，比如皮疹，则比较不寻常。团队在此之前就要求过将皮疹添加到官方的症状清单中，并且指出在感染新冠的成人中也有皮疹症状。

“It is certainly as important as the other features, and in children it is much more important,” he said. “One in six children will have [a rash] and many times it will be the only sign, and you don’t get a funny rash with most coughs, colds [or] flus.”

“皮疹完全和其他症状一样重要，并且在儿童中则更为突出。”他说，“1/6的儿童存在皮疹症状，并且很多时候是唯一症状。并且大多数咳嗽、着凉、流感都不会使你得了个疹子。”

Spector said the difference in symptoms with age were probably down to differences in the way the immune system responded to the virus, and he said the team were now calling for parents to track their children’s symptoms on the app to help the team spot school outbreaks quickly.

Spector称年龄间的症状差距可能是由于免疫系统对病毒的不同应对措施而造成的。并且他的团队目前正在要求父母们通过app及时跟踪他们孩子的症状，以帮助团队快速的识别校园疫情爆发。

Dr Tom Waterfield of Queen’s University Belfast, who was not involved in the research, said the findings **chimed with** his own work showing that symptoms such as fatigue, headaches and an upset stomach were common among children with Covid-19, while symptoms such as coughs were rarer than in adults.

没有参与到这项研究的贝尔法斯特女王大学的Tom Waterfield博士，说这些发现和他自己的研究工作相吻合。他的工作表明诸如疲倦、头痛、和胃部不适都是儿童感染新冠的普遍症状，另一方面像咳嗽之类的则比成人罕见的多。

Dr Sanjay Patel, a **paediatric** infectious diseases **consultant** at Southampton children’s hospital cautioned that while the NHS checklist would not mean all children with Covid were detected, it still allowed school outbreaks to be spotted, while many of the symptoms highlighted by the new study could be the result of a host of different illnesses, and keeping children home based on such signs could be problematic.

Southampton 儿童医院的儿童感染性疾病顾问，Sanjay Patel博士指出，NHS清单不会使所有新冠感染儿童得到检测，因此它仍会使校园疫情爆发。另一方面新研究强调的很多症状
可能是多种疾病在一个宿主上共同作用的结果，只是根据这些症状就要把儿童隔离在家也是有问题的。

“The harms of that approach are very **tangible**,” he said. “Many children would be missing a lot of school, and the majority of children being tested would still be negative.”

“这种措施的不足是显而易见的，”他说到，“大量儿童将会错失大量校园时光，并且大多数儿童检测结果都是阴性的。”

Prof Martin Marshall, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, welcomed the study. “Understanding that children may exhibit symptoms that are different to adults is useful in order for GPs and our teams, as well as our specialist paediatric colleagues, to identify the virus in children and respond appropriately,” he said.

GPs皇家学院主席，Prof Martin Marshall，对这项研究表示支持。“明白儿童有着和成人不同的症状对GPs和我们的团队来说是很有帮助的。并且也有益于我们的儿科专家同事们，更好的是被儿童的感染情况，并做出合适的应对。”他说到。
