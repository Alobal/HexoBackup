# California's record-breaking heatwave sparks wildfires and raises health concerns
加利福尼亚州破纪录的热浪引发了野火以及健康隐患

California is **sweltering** under a record-breaking heatwave this holiday weekend, with dangerous conditions that have sparked several new wildfires and raised widespread public health concerns.

加州在这个周末迎来了破纪录的热浪，随之而来的是数起新的野外火灾，以及快速扩散的公共健康隐患。

Triple-digit temperatures have spread over much of the state, including a record-high of 125F (52C) in Death Valley on Saturday. In southern California, Malibu authorities reported that one **hiker** died due to heat while on a trail in the Santa Monica Mountains.

大多数州的温度已经到达了三位数，其中在周六 Death Valley 到达了有史以来最高的 125F。在加州南部，Malibu 当局报道称一名远足者热死在了 Saanta Monica Mountains 的一条小道上。

The heat, coupled with a forecast of possible dry, **gusty** winds, has made for dangerous weekend fire weather, at a time when nearly 13,000 firefighters are currently battling to contain nearly two dozen major fires around California.

这个热度，加上预测可能有的干燥，阵风，合在一起构成了周末危险的火一般的天气。在此同时，有将近 13000 名消防员正在和环绕加州的两打的大火作斗争。

A wildfire that broke out near Shaver Lake in the Sierra National Forest **prompted** **evacuation** orders Saturday as authorities urged people seeking relief from the heat wave to stay away from the popular lake. That **blaze**, called the Creek fire, has burned 36,000 **acres**, trapping at least 150 people near a **reservoir** in Fresno county and injuring dozens who had to be airlifted to the hospital.

一场在 Sierra 国家森林的 Shaver 湖附近爆发的火灾，促使了周六的疏散令——当局要求想要从热浪中寻求放松的人们，远离那个著名的湖。那场叫做 Creek fire 的火，已经燃烧了 36000 英亩，在 Fresno 县的一个水库附近困住了至少 150 个人，并且使数十人受伤以至于被空运到医院。

In San Bernardino county east of Los Angeles, a fast-moving fire in the foothills of Yucaipa forced the evacuation of Oak Glen, a farm community that just opened its apple-picking season this weekend. A fast-moving fire in the San Diego area quickly grew to 1,500 acres on Saturday, prompting evacuations and destroying at least two homes.

在洛杉矶东部的 San Bernardino 县，一场在 Yucaipa 山麓移动迅速的大火，迫使 Oak Glen 进行了疏散。那儿是一个农场区域，并且刚刚在周末迎来它的苹果采摘季。另一场在 San Diego 区域移动迅速的大火，在周六已经扩散到了 1500 英亩，促使了当地的疏散，并且使至少两座房屋被摧毁。

Families **flocked** to the beaches across southern California, where authorities closed parking lots after they filled to capacity, and lifeguards reported massive crowds. Health authorities warned that beaches could be closed if they become too crowded, due to concerns about the spread of coronavirus, which the state continues to battle.

无数的家庭蜂拥而至南加州的海滩，在那儿政府关闭了载满的停车场，并且救生员不停地报道着大规模人群。政府健康部门警告如果沙滩变得太拥挤的话，由于对这个州仍在应对的新冠病毒的担心，沙滩很可能将要关闭。

Gatherings during the Fourth of July weekend were blamed in part for Covid-19 spikes earlier this summer, and authorities have urged people to continue practicing social distancing and mask-wearing this weekend. Indoor gatherings are more dangerous, though the heat and poor air quality has made it difficult to be outside in some parts of California this weekend.

在 7 月 4 号的一场周末聚集，一定程度上是 Covid-19 在这个夏季早期达到顶峰的始作俑者。并且政府督促人们在这个周末继续保持社交距离，并且带好口罩。室内聚会则是更加危险的，尽管这周末在加州几个地区，热度和较差的空气质量让人很难想着去户外。

Campgrounds in the popular San Bernardino national forest east of LA were also full, and **rangers** were out in force on **“marshmallow** patrols” – keeping an especially close watch for campfires and barbecues outside of designated sites that pose a potential risk of setting a wildfire.

在洛杉矶东部著名的 San Bernardino 国家森林中的露营也一样达到了爆满。并且出动了护林员以贯彻“棉花糖巡逻”——持续密切监控在规定区域以外的营火和烧烤，它们有着成为野外火灾的潜在风险。

“On a day like today I’m glad I work inside and I can eat ice cream all day,” said Mai Emami, who said a steady number of customers were coming to the Cup & Cone Ice Cream shop in Woodland Hills to pick up their orders.

“在一个像今天这样的一天，我很高兴我是在室内工作。并且我能一整天吃冰淇淋。”Mai Emami 说道。他说有稳定数量的消费者会来到在 Woodland 山脉的 Cup & Cone 冰淇淋店提取他们的订单。

The heatwave has also raised concerns about power **outages**, with officials urging people to **conserve** electricity to ease strain on the state’s power grid.

热浪也提升了电源断供的可能性，因此政府督促人们节约用电以减缓州电网的压力。

The weather service predicted “brutally hot” temperatures through Monday as a high pressure system **perches** over the western US. Heat warnings were also in effect in Arizona and Nevada. Downtown Los Angeles reached 110F (43.3C) on Saturday. Temperatures in inland parts of the San Francisco Bay Area were **soaring** to the low 100s.

天气服务部门在周一预测，由于美国西部上空悬浮的高压天气的停留，温度将会达到“酷热”的程度。热度警告在 Arizona 和 Nevada 也同样适用。洛杉矶市中心在周六达到了 110F 华氏度。而在旧金山湾的内陆地区温度则飙升至【100 华氏度左右】。

The extreme weather can also be **brutal** for people in California prisons, which have suffered major Covid outbreaks as well as terrible air quality from nearby fires.

对于加州监狱的人来讲，这个极端天气更为残暴。他们经历了新冠病毒的爆发，并且经受了附近火灾的糟糕透顶的空气质量。

The heatwave also poses significant challenges for the state’s large homeless population, with thousands living outside in encampments and cars and other **makeshift** living quarters.

随着成千上万的人在户外露宿生活、车旅生活以及在临时居住区生活，热浪也给这个州庞大的流浪人口问题带来了重大挑战。

The Rev Andy Bales, president and CEO of Union Rescue Mission at Skid Row, the epicenter of LA’s homeless epidemic, said he told staff to hand out “the coldest of cold water bottles” to those coming by for to-go lunches over the weekend. “And I said if anyone comes to the door overheated and in peril, welcome them in,“ he said. “We do have an air-conditioned chapel.”

Rev Andy Bales，联合救援团的主席兼首席执行官，在流浪者的中心 Skid Row 说道他已经告诉工作人员分发“装着最冷的水的水瓶”给那些这周末想要过来吃午餐的人。“并且我也说了，如果任何人中暑或者处于危险，欢迎他们进来，”他说道，“我们确实有一个空调教堂。”

Volunteers with the CHAM Deliverance Ministry in San Jose planned to deliver bottled water and sports drinks to homeless people in Silicon Valley.

San Jose 的 CHAM 运送部门以及相关志愿者，计划运送瓶装水和运动饮料给那些在 Silicon Valley 的流浪者。

“When it’s 105F and you’re living in a creek bed in a tent, it’s a lot of health issues out there. It’s a formula for disaster,” pastor and founder Scott Wagers said.

“当天气达到了 105 华氏度，而你住在一个帐篷里的小床上，这将充满健康问题。这简直就是一个灾难的配方。”身为牧师的发起人 Scott Wagers 说道。
